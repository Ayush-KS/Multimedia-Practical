        And this is a sample paragraph. Nothing to fancy. Unless I add some sassy 
        <i>
            Italics! Italiced text gives a little 
            emphasis to the plain text.
        </i>
    </p>

        Back to being plain. Without formatting, any text looks raw and very machine like. If we really want to express
        ourselves, we can go 
        <b>
            Bold! Notice how the thickness of the text increases and this text creates more IMPACT.
        </b>
    </p>

        HTML also allows us to make use of another formatting tag known as the underline tag! When we do not want
        the actual appearance of the text to change and still want the text to stand out, 
        <u>
            Underlining the text is the most appropriate way to do that!
        </u>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Also, notice that the text above is cleanly partitioned using horizontal lines. We can also use the line break tag to 
        <br>
        <br>
        simply add lines

        <br>
        <br>
        between chunks of texts!
